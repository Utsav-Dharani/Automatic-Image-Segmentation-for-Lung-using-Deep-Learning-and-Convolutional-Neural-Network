# 🫁 Automatic Image Segmentation for Lung using Deep Learning and CNN
**A deep learning-based project for automatic lung image segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).**

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
The main goal of this project is to develop an automated system for **lung image segmentation** using deep learning models. The model employs **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to segment the lung from medical images such as CT scans. This model can be used in medical diagnostics to help doctors in identifying lung-related issues, including cancer and pneumonia. This repository contains a deep learning model for **automatic segmentation of lung images**, which is essential for detecting and analyzing lung diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. The model utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for accurate and efficient segmentation. 

✅ **Key Features:**
- Lung image segmentation using **CNN and deep learning** models.
- Supports **Lung CT Scans, X-ray, and other medical images**.
- Utilizes **Git LFS** for large file handling.
- Includes pre-trained models and evaluation metrics.
